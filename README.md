# Simple-hiragana-exercise
It's a simple (and very limited) program which can be useful in the study of hiragana.
It was a pain to write so i chose to make it available to anyone who need it.

## Basics
Simply put this program can give an output of (the number specified by the user) hiragana characters written in romanji.
I'm only a student so don't be too harsh on the code...

## Data
The program was written for linux systems.
It can work on some ChromeOS pc (using linux mode).
