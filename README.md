# Simple-hiragana-exercise
It's a simple (and very limited) program which can be useful in the study of hiragana.
It was a pain to write so i chose to make it available to anyone who need it.

## Basics
Simply put this program can give an output of (the number specified by the user) hiragana characters written in romanji.
I'm only a student so don't be too harsh on the code...
The program was buildt to be powerful, simple and useful; i still don't know how to make it visually appealing so it's a simple shell program.

## Data (don't know how to call it...)
The program was written for linux systems.
It can work on ChromeOS (using linux mode).
the program was limited to 200 consecutive characters... for common sense reasons... it can be easily modified in the control cycle of n.
